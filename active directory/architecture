# Active Directory Objects

## What is an Object in Active Directory (AD)?
An object is **any resource** present within an Active Directory environment, such as:  
- Organizational Units (OUs)  
- Printers  
- Users  
- Domain Controllers, and more.

## Common AD Objects and Their Descriptions

### Users
- Leaf objects (cannot contain other objects).  
- Considered security principals (have a Security Identifier (SID) and a Global Unique Identifier (GUID)).  
- Have many attributes such as display name, last login time, password change date, email, description, manager, address, etc.  
- Important attack targets since even low-privilege user accounts can provide access to many resources and allow domain enumeration.

### Contacts
- Represent external users (e.g., third-party vendors or customers).  
- Leaf objects, **not** security principals (do **not** have SID, only GUID).  
- Contain informational attributes like first name, last name, email, and phone number.

### Printers
- Point to network printers accessible within AD.  
- Leaf objects and **not** security principals (have only a GUID).  
- Attributes include printer name, driver info, port number, etc.

### Computers
- Any computer (workstation or server) joined to the AD network.  
- Leaf objects and security principals (have SID and GUID).  
- Full admin access to a computer can grant similar privileges as a domain user and enables most enumeration tasks.

### Shared Folders
- Represent shared folders on specific computers.  
- Not security principals (only GUID).  
- Attributes include name, location, and access control settings.  
- Access can range from public to restricted to specific users/groups.

### Groups
- Container objects that can hold users, computers, and other groups (nested groups).  
- Security principals (have SID and GUID).  
- Used to manage user permissions and access to resources.  
- Nested groups can lead to unintended privilege escalation.  
- Attributes include name, description, membership, and parent groups.

### Organizational Units (OUs)
- Containers used to organize and manage AD objects for easier administration.  
- Allow delegation of administrative tasks without giving full domain admin rights.  
- Used to apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subsets of users and computers.  
- Attributes include name, members, and security settings.

### Domain
- The structural boundary of an AD network.  
- Contains users, computers, groups, and OUs.  
- Each domain has its own database and policies (e.g., password policies).  
- Policies can be customized to restrict or grant access to resources.

### Domain Controllers
- The "brains" of the AD network.  
- Handle authentication, verify users, and enforce security policies.  
- Store information about all objects in the domain.

### Sites
- Collections of computers connected by high-speed links across one or more subnets.  
- Optimize replication between domain controllers.

### Built-in Container
- Holds default groups created automatically when an AD domain is set up.

### Foreign Security Principals (FSPs)
- Placeholder objects representing security principals from trusted external forests.  
- Created automatically when an external user, group, or computer is added to a group in the local domain.  
- Hold the SID of the foreign object and help resolve names via trust relationships.  
- Located in the container `ForeignSecurityPrincipals` with distinguished names like `cn=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,dc=domain,dc=local`.
