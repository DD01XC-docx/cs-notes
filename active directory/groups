## 🔹 Groups vs. Organizational Units (OUs)

| Feature         | **Groups**                              | **Organizational Units (OUs)**                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Main Purpose** | Assign **permissions** to resources      | Organize for **Group Policy** and **delegation** |
| **Can Contain** | Users, computers, **other groups**       | Users, computers, groups, **other OUs**          |
| **Used For**    | Resource access control (e.g., shares)   | Applying GPOs, delegating administrative control |

## 🔹 Group Types

- **Security Group**
  - Used to **assign permissions** (e.g., file share, printer).
  - Can be added to ACLs.
  - Can send emails **and** control access.

- **Distribution Group**
  - **Email only** (used by Exchange, Outlook).
  - Cannot be used to control access to resources.

## 🔹 Group Scopes

| Scope         | Can Contain Members From     | Can Be Used In              | Use Case                                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain Local** | Any domain                   | **Only in the same domain** | Best for assigning permissions **within a domain**          |
| **Global**       | Same domain only             | Any domain in the forest    | Best for **grouping users** by department or role           |
| **Universal**    | Any domain                   | Any domain in the forest    | Best for **assigning permissions across domains**           |

## 🔁 Nested Group Membership

- Groups can be members of **other groups**.
- **Users may inherit permissions** from **indirect group membership**.
- Example:
  - `User → Help Desk → Help Desk Level 1 → Tier 1 Admins`
- 🧪 Use **BloodHound** to visualize and audit these relationships.

## 🔐 Important Attributes (LDAP)

| Attribute    | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `cn`         | Common name (group's name in AD)                    |
| `member`     | Users, groups, or contacts inside the group         |
| `memberOf`   | Lists **parent groups** (used for nesting tracking) |
| `groupType`  | Integer: indicates **type + scope**                 |
| `objectSid`  | Unique SID for the group                            |

## 🔄 Group Scope Conversion Rules

| Convert From → To         | Conditions                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global → Universal         | Only if **not nested** in another Global group                            |
| Domain Local → Universal   | Only if it **does not contain other Domain Local groups**                 |
| Universal → Domain Local   | ✅ Can be done without restriction                                         |
| Universal → Global         | Only if it **does not contain other Universal groups**                    |

## 🏗️ Built-In vs. Custom Groups

- **Built-in Groups**
  - Created when domain is initialized
  - Most are **Domain Local** scope
  - Cannot nest other groups inside
  - Example: `Administrators`, `Users`, `Guests`

- **Custom Groups**
  - Created by admins for organizational purposes
  - Can be Security or Distribution, any scope
  - Common when Exchange or new services are added

## 🛠 Tools for Analysis

- 🔍 **BloodHound**: Graph-based visualization of group/user relationships.
- 🧠 Useful for both **pen testers** and **sysadmins**.
- Helps find privilege escalation paths and misconfigurations.

> 📚 **Pro Tip**: Always review group memberships during domain audits and pentests — nested memberships and overly permissive groups are common attack vectors.
