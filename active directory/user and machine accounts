# 🧑‍💻 User and Machine Accounts in Active Directory

## User Accounts

User accounts are created both locally and in Active Directory (AD) to give a person or service access to computers and network resources based on their rights.

### Key Points:
- When a user logs in:
  - Password is verified.
  - An **access token** is created.
  - Token includes security identity and group membership.
- Tokens are used every time the user interacts with a process.

### Use Cases:
- Allow employees/contractors to log in and access resources.
- Run services/programs under a specific security context.
- Manage access to:
  - Network shares
  - Files
  - Applications

### Groups:
- Users can be assigned to groups.
- Groups simplify administration (privileges assigned to groups instead of individual users).

### AD User Provisioning:
- Every employee typically has at least **one AD account**.
- Admins/Help Desk may have **multiple accounts**.
- **Service accounts** are used to run applications/services.
- Companies often keep **disabled accounts** for auditing purposes (e.g., in a `FORMER EMPLOYEES` OU).

### Rights:
- Users can have rights from read-only to full enterprise control.
- Misconfigurations can occur easily and be exploited.
- User accounts are a major attack surface.

## Local Accounts

Local accounts exist **only on the local machine**. Rights are granted **only on that host**.

### Default Local Accounts:

- **Administrator**
  - SID: `S-1-5-domain-500`
  - Cannot be deleted/locked, but can be renamed or disabled.
  - Default account created on Windows install.

- **Guest**
  - Disabled by default.
  - Limited access, blank password by default.
  - Security risk — should remain disabled.

- **SYSTEM (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`)**
  - Used by the OS for internal functions.
  - Has full control over the system.
  - Highest permission level on a Windows host.
  - Cannot be seen in User Manager or added to groups.

- **Network Service**
  - Used to run Windows services.
  - Presents credentials to remote services.

- **Local Service**
  - Minimal privileges on the host.
  - Presents **anonymous** credentials to the network.

📌 See [Microsoft's official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/) for more details on default accounts.

## Domain Users

Domain users are granted access by the **domain**, not the local machine.

### Key Differences:
- Can log in from **any domain-joined host**.
- Have access to:
  - File servers
  - Printers
  - Intranet resources

### Special Account: `KRBTGT`
- Built-in service account for **Kerberos Key Distribution**.
- Common attack target (e.g., **Golden Ticket attack**).
- Gaining access = domain-wide compromise.

| `objectSID`       | Security Identifier; defines user and group memberships.                    |
| `sIDHistory`      | Stores previous SIDs (used in domain migrations).                           |
