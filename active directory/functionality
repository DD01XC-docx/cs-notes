# Active Directory Overview

## FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)

| Role               | Description                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema Master**   | Manages the read/write copy of the AD schema defining all object attributes in AD.                            |
| **Domain Naming Master** | Manages domain names and prevents duplicate domain names within the same forest.                            |
| **RID Master**      | Assigns RID blocks to DCs to ensure unique SIDs for domain objects (SID = Domain SID + RID).                  |
| **PDC Emulator**    | Authoritative DC handling authentication, password changes, Group Policy Objects (GPO), and domain time sync.|
| **Infrastructure Master** | Translates GUIDs, SIDs, and DNs between domains in multi-domain forests to resolve names in ACLs properly.  |

*Note:* FSMO role issues can cause authentication and authorization problems.

## Domain and Forest Functional Levels

### Domain Functional Levels

| **Windows Server 2008 R2** | Authentication mechanism assurance, Managed Service Accounts                        | Windows 2008 R2 to 2012 R2                            |
| **Windows Server 2012** | KDC support for claims, compound authentication, Kerberos armoring                      | Windows 2012, 2012 R2                                 |
| **Windows Server 2012 R2** | Protected Users group protections, Authentication Policies, Policy Silos             | Windows 2012 R2                                       |

> **Note:** No new functional level was added in Windows Server 2019, but Server 2008 functional level is minimum for Server 2019 DCs.

### Forest Functional Levels

| Version               | Capabilities                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows Server 2003** | Forest trust, domain renaming, read-only domain controllers (RODC)                              |
| **Windows Server 2008** | New domains default to Server 2008 domain functional level                                      |
| **Windows Server 2008 R2** | Active Directory Recycle Bin to restore deleted objects                                      |

| **Windows Server 2012 R2** | New domains default to Server 2012 R2 domain functional level                                |
| **Windows Server 2016** | Privileged Access Management (PAM) using Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM)                      |

## Trusts in Active Directory

Trusts enable authentication across domains or forests, allowing resource access outside the user's domain.

### Trust Types

| Type           | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parent-child** | Two-way transitive trust between parent and child domains within the same forest                  |
| **Cross-link**   | Trust between child domains to speed up authentication                                           |
| **External**     | Non-transitive trust between separate domains/forests not linked by forest trust; uses SID filtering |
| **Tree-root**    | Two-way transitive trust between forest root and new tree root domain, created by design          |
| **Forest**       | Transitive trust between two forest root domains                                                  |

### Trust Characteristics

- **Transitive trust:** Trust extends to all trusted child domains.
- **Non-transitive trust:** Trust limited to the specified domain only.
- **One-way trust:** Users from the trusted domain access resources in the trusting domain only.
- **Two-way trust:** Mutual access between both domains.

> **Security Note:** Improperly configured trusts can introduce attack vectors (e.g., Kerberoasting attacks across trusts), especially common after mergers or acquisitions.

# Summary

- FSMO roles are critical for AD operation and must be correctly assigned.
- Functional levels define AD features and supported DC OS versions.
- Trusts enable cross-domain authentication but must be managed carefully to avoid security risks.
