# üõ°Ô∏è Active Directory Security Notes

## üî∫ CIA Triad in AD
- **Confidentiality**: Access control.
- **Integrity**: Ensures data authenticity.
- **Availability**: Ensures continuous access to resources.

AD leans heavily towards **Availability** ‚Üí secure by design is not default.

---

## üîß General Hardening Measures

### 1. **Microsoft LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)**
- Randomizes and rotates local admin passwords.
- Prevents lateral movement.
- Set rotation interval (e.g. every 12 or 24 hours).

---

### 2. **Audit Policy Settings**
- Monitor for:
  - Unauthorized account creation.
  - Password changes.
  - Unusual logons.
  - Attack indicators (e.g., password spraying).
- Helps detect AD enumeration and modern Kerberos attacks.

---

### 3. **Group Policy Security Settings**
**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** can enforce:
- **Account Policies**: Password, lockout, Kerberos settings.
- **Local Policies**: Audit policy, user rights, security options.
- **Software Restriction Policies**: Control what apps can be run.
- **Application Control Policies** (AppLocker): Block CMD, PowerShell, etc.
- **Advanced Audit Policy Configuration**: File access, logons, privilege use.

---

### 4. **Update Management**
- **WSUS**: Free, server role for patching.
- **SCCM**: Paid, feature-rich patching platform.
- Ensures timely and broad security patch deployment.

---

### 5. **Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)**
- Used for non-interactive services/tasks.
- Passwords are 120 characters, auto-rotated.
- No human password knowledge required.

---

## üë• User & Group Security

### 6. **Security Groups**
- Assign rights/resources by group, not individual.
- Default groups: `Domain Admins`, `Account Operators`, `Backup Operators`, etc.
- Simplifies permission management.

### 7. **Account Separation**
- Admins need:
  - Daily account: `user.name`
  - Admin account: `user.name_adm`
- Mitigates compromise risk via phishing or malware.

---

## üîë Authentication Best Practices

### 8. **Password Complexity + MFA**
- Use **passphrases** or **random long passwords** (‚â•12 chars).
- Avoid common passwords (e.g., Welcome1).
- Disallow months, seasons, company name, etc.
- Enforce **2FA** for RDP.

---

### 9. **Limit Domain Admin Usage**
- Use **only** on Domain Controllers.
- Avoid using on workstations or jump hosts.
- Prevents password leaks in memory dumps.

---

## üßπ Maintenance & Auditing

### 10. **Stale Object Cleanup**
- Disable/remove:
  - Old user accounts.
  - Obsolete service accounts.

### 11. **Access Reviews**
- Audit:
  - Local Admin access.
  - Domain Admin and Enterprise Admin count.
  - File shares and group memberships.

---

## üîç Audit & Monitoring

### 12. **Audit Policies & Logging**
- Detect:
  - Login anomalies.
  - AD enumeration.
  - Kerberoasting.
- Follow Microsoft Audit Policy Recommendations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Group Control & Host Roles

### 13. **Restricted Groups via GPO**
- Enforce exact group membership:
  - Local Administrators.
  - Domain Admins.
  - Enterprise Admins.

### 14. **Limit Server Roles**
- Avoid:
  - IIS on Domain Controllers.
  - Exchange + web apps together.
  - Web + DB on same host.

---

### 15. **Limit Local Admin and RDP Rights**
- Don‚Äôt add `Domain Users` to local `Administrators`.
- Control RDP access tightly to minimize attack surface.
