# Group Policy and Blocking Executables

## What is Group Policy?
- Windows feature to manage user and computer settings in a domain.
- Managed via Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
- GPOs can be linked to Sites, Domains, or Organizational Units (OUs).
- Provides centralized management of security settings, software, policies, etc.

## Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Collections of policy settings applied to users or computers.
- Can control:
  - Password policies
  - USB/removable media restrictions
  - Screensaver and lock settings
  - Application restrictions
  - Audit and logging policies
  - Software deployment
  - Logon banners and scripts

## GPO Order of Precedence
- Local Group Policy
- Site Policy
- Domain-wide Policy
- OU Policies (parent OU → child OU)
- Enforced policies override lower-level policies.
- Block inheritance can prevent policies from higher levels applying.

## Blocking Users from Running Executables
- Use **Software Restriction Policies (SRP)** or **AppLocker** via Group Policy.
- These policies can:
  - Block all executables (*.exe) for specific users or groups.
  - Restrict applications by path, hash, or publisher.
- Applied typically in:
  - Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Software Restriction Policies
  - Or under Application Control Policies → AppLocker

## Security Considerations
- Misconfigured GPOs can be abused by attackers for:
  - Privilege escalation
  - Lateral movement
  - Persistence
- Proper delegation and auditing of GPO modification rights is critical.

## Summary
- Group Policy is a powerful tool to enforce security settings in a Windows domain.
- Blocking users from running executables can be achieved with Software Restriction Policies or AppLocker GPOs.
- GPOs apply based on hierarchy and precedence.
- Secure management of GPOs is vital to avoid abuse.
