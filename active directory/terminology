# Active Directory Terminology

## Object
Any resource in Active Directory (AD), such as OUs, users, printers, domain controllers, etc.

## Attributes
Characteristics of an object, like hostname or DNS name. Each attribute has an LDAP name (e.g., `displayName`, `givenName`).

## Schema
Blueprint defining object classes and attributes in AD. Objects are instances of classes (e.g., user, computer).

## Domain
Logical group of AD objects (users, computers, groups, OUs). Domains can be independent or linked by trusts.

## Forest
Top-level container holding one or more domains. Acts as a security boundary and contains all AD objects.

## Tree
Collection of domains in a forest starting from a single root domain. Domains have parent-child trust relationships and share a Global Catalog.

## Container
An object that holds other objects in the AD hierarchy.

## Leaf
An object that does **not** contain other objects; it is at the end of the hierarchy.

## Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
A unique 128-bit ID assigned to every AD object, stored in `objectGUID`. It never changes and ensures accurate object identification.

## Security Principals
Domain objects that can be authenticated and granted access rights (users, computers, processes). Local accounts are managed by SAM.

## Security Identifier (SID)
Unique identifier for security principals and groups, issued by the domain controller. SIDs never get reused.

## Distinguished Name (DN)
Full path to an object in AD (e.g., `cn=bjones,ou=IT,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`).

## Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
The unique component of a DN at a given level (e.g., `cn=bjones`).

## sAMAccountName
User logon name (e.g., `bjones`). Unique and limited to 20 characters.

## userPrincipalName (UPN)
User login in email format (e.g., `bjones@inlanefreight.local`).

## FSMO Roles
Flexible Single Master Operation roles assign critical domain controller responsibilities:
- **Schema Master** (forest-wide)
- **Domain Naming Master** (forest-wide)
- **RID Master** (per domain)
- **PDC Emulator** (per domain)
- **Infrastructure Master** (per domain)

## Global Catalog (GC)
A domain controller that holds a full copy of its domainâ€™s objects and partial copies from other domains to enable forest-wide searches and authentication.

## Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
A domain controller with a read-only AD database. It does not cache passwords except for itself and supports reduced replication and admin role separation.

## Replication
Process of syncing AD changes between domain controllers, managed by the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC).

## Service Principal Name (SPN)
Unique identifier for a service instance, used in Kerberos authentication.

## Group Policy Object (GPO)
Collections of policy settings applied to users or computers, identified by a unique GUID.

## Access Control List (ACL)
List of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that define permissions on an object.

## Access Control Entry (ACE)
An entry in an ACL that grants or denies access rights to a trustee (user, group, or session).

## Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
Defines allowed or denied access rights to an object. Absence of a DACL grants full access to everyone.

## System Access Control List (SACL)
Logs access attempts to secured objects.

## Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
Complete DNS name of a host (e.g., `DC01.inlanefreight.local`).

## Tombstone
Deleted AD objects kept for a period (Tombstone Lifetime) before permanent removal. Tombstoned objects lose most attributes.

## AD Recycle Bin
Feature to recover deleted objects with full attributes preserved for a configurable retention period.

## SYSVOL
Shared directory on domain controllers storing scripts and Group Policy data replicated across the domain.
