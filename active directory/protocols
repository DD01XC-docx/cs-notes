# Active Directory Protocols Overview

Active Directory (AD) in Windows environments relies on several core protocols to handle authentication, communication, and directory services. The main protocols involved are **Kerberos**, **DNS**, **LDAP**, and **MSRPC**.

---

## Kerberos

- Default authentication protocol for domain accounts since Windows 2000.
- Open standard enabling interoperability across systems.
- Uses **mutual authentication**: both client and server verify identities.
- **Ticket-based** system: avoids transmitting passwords over the network.
- Key components:
  - **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** on Domain Controllers issues tickets.
  - **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**: granted upon login.
  - **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**: granted to access specific services.
- Authentication flow:
  1. Client sends encrypted timestamp to KDC using user’s password.
  2. KDC decrypts and issues TGT encrypted with `krbtgt` key.
  3. Client requests TGS using TGT.
  4. KDC issues TGS encrypted with service’s NTLM hash.
  5. Client presents TGS to service to gain access.
- Uses **port 88** (TCP/UDP).
- Decouples user credentials from resource requests — no password sent over the network.

## DNS

- AD relies on DNS to locate Domain Controllers and services.
- Resolves hostnames to IP addresses, essential for network communication.
- Uses **Service Records (SRV)** to help clients find network services (e.g., Domain Controllers, file servers).
- Supports **Dynamic DNS** to update IP addresses automatically.
- DNS query example commands:
  - Forward lookup:  
    ```powershell
    nslookup INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    ```
  - Reverse lookup:  
    ```powershell
    nslookup 172.16.6.5
    ```
- Uses **port 53** (UDP/TCP).

## LDAP

- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used for directory lookups and authentication.
- AD acts as an LDAP directory server.
- LDAP sessions start by connecting to the Directory System Agent (Domain Controller).
- Two authentication methods:
  - **Simple Authentication**: username/password (bind request).
  - **SASL Authentication**: uses external services like Kerberos for binding.
- Default LDAP port: **389**; LDAPS (LDAP over SSL): **636**.
- LDAP messages are cleartext by default; use TLS/SSL to encrypt.
- LDAP allows querying and managing directory data (users, groups, computers).

## MSRPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)

- Microsoft’s implementation of RPC for interprocess communication.
- Key MSRPC interfaces used in AD:
  - **lsarpc**: manages local security policies and audits.
  - **netlogon**: authenticates users and services in the domain.
  - **samr**: manages the Security Account Manager (users, groups, computers). Used in tools like BloodHound for AD reconnaissance.
  - **drsuapi**: Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol; used for replicating AD database across Domain Controllers and can be exploited to dump password hashes.

# Summary

| Protocol | Purpose                                   | Port(s)    |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| Kerberos | Authentication with ticket-based system   | 88 TCP/UDP |
| DNS      | Name resolution and service location       | 53 TCP/UDP |
| LDAP     | Directory lookup and authentication        | 389 (LDAP), 636 (LDAPS) |
| MSRPC    | Remote procedure calls for AD management   | Various RPC ports |

**Note:** Understanding these protocols is essential for managing, defending, or attacking Active Directory environments.
